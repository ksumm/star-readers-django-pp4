## Deployment & Local Development

### Remote Deployment

Before deploying, run 'pip3 freeze > requirements.txt' on the terminal of your IDE of choice.

The site was deployed to Heroku. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  1. Create an account and log in your [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) account. 
  2. On the dashboard, click on the button New -> Create new app on the right side of the page.
  3. Choose a name and select your region. Click on Create app.
  4. Go to the Settings tab. Scroll down to Config Vars. 
  - Add key PORT and value 8000.
  - Add key DATABASE_URL and add the value of your database on ElephantSQL or other host of choice.
  - Add key CLOUDINARY_URL and add the value of your cloudinary host link.
  - Add key SECRET_KEY and add the value of your choice for this secret key.
  - Add key DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC and add the value of 1. (Don't forget to remove this key before the final deployment.)
  5. Go to the Deploy tab. Select GitHub as Deployment Method. Connect your account.
  6. Enter the name of the repository that you forked, search and connect.
  7. Select the branch and click Deploy Branch.

### Local Deployment

#### How to Fork

  1. Log In or Sign Up to GitHub.
  2. Go to this project repository https://github.com/ksumm/star-readers-django-pp4
  2. On the top right of the page, there's a button with the option Fork. Click on it.
  3. A new page, "Create a new fork", will open. If you wish, you can edit the name.
  4. At the end of the page, click on "Create fork".
  5. Now, you have a copy of the project in your repositories.

#### How to Clone

  1. Log In or Sign Up to GitHub.
  2. Go to this project repository [https://github.com/ksumm/star-readers-django-pp4](https://github.com/ksumm/star-readers-django-pp4)
  3. Click on the Code button and select if you would like to clone with HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI and copy the link.
  4. Open the terminal in the code editor of your choice and change the current working directory to the one you will use for to clone the repository.
  5. Type 'git clone' into the terminal and then paste the link you copied before and press Enter.

#### Using Gitpod
If you would like to edit your copy of this repository on Gitpod, you will need to: 
  1. On your browser of choice, install the Gitpod extension/add-on.
  2. On GitHub, open the project repository you forked before.
  3. On the top of the page, over the files, there is a green button on the right side of the page saying "Gitpod". Click it.
  4. It will open the Gitpod website. On the first time, you will select to connect with your GitHub account and Authorize gitpod-io. After that, you'll create an account.
  5. It might take a while after that because Gitpod will create your workspace.
  After the workspace is loaded, you can edit it on Gitpod.
